Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # @param {TreeNode} root
    # @return {TreeNode}
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if root == None:
            return root
            
        left = root.left
        right = root.right
        
        root.left = self.invertTree(right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(left)
        return root
